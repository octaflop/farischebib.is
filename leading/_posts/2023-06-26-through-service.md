For the past seven years, with a hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been a "Kid's Crew" volunteer at Primary Children's Hospital. This role is more than just a volunteer positionâ€”it's a commitment to filling gaps, addressing the non-medical needs of child patients, and making their healing journey a bit brighter. This endeavor entails a variety of responsibilities, ranging from practical tasks such as cleaning to more creative pursuits like planning activities and crafts.

In the midst of my service, I've found myself surrounded by younger pre-med volunteers from the local university. As one of the more seasoned volunteers, I often step into a leadership role, guiding others in patient safety protocols and day-room check-in procedures. However, my true passion lies in going beyond the standard protocol and instilling an intrinsic motivation in my fellow volunteers.

This motivation comes from the understanding that for the families of our patients, they're navigating one of the most challenging times in their lives. Our role as volunteers is to alleviate this hardship, even if it's just by a fraction, with every interaction. Emphasizing this shared value is a cornerstone of my approach to leadership. Value-based leadership. It's not a new idea, but it's a foundational part of how I practice the privilege of leading others.

The measure of success for me is not just in the smooth running of operations, but in seeing this value reflected in the actions of other volunteers. It's in the moments when, instead of reaching for their phones during a quiet spell, volunteers begin preparing craft kits or contacting patient pods to see who might need a bit of company.

This ethos of service and value-based leadership has resonated throughout my professional career as well. As an engineering manager, I've had the privilege of leading development teams at a large genetics company. There, I've strived to instill a sense of purpose that extends beyond the lines of code. I remind my team that each challenge we overcome in debugging spaghetti codes translates to countless patients gaining access to crucial genetic diagnoses, helping them move forward with their lives.

In both my volunteering and professional roles, I've found that value-based leadership can instill a deep sense of purpose, drive engagement, and inspire teams to go beyond their routine duties. It's about creating a shared understanding that the work we do, no matter how seemingly mundane, has the power to positively impact lives. And it's this knowledge that makes what I do my dream job.
