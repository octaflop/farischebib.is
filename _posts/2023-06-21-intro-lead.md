There's always something awkward about joining a new team. Doubly so when you are tasked with **leading** the new team. It's stressful for those you're going to be supporting, because they are entering a new relationship with perhaps some old expectations. This is a situation I have played out a ton in my head and have experienced numerous times over the course of my software engineering career.
